Revision history for Data-Sah

0.02     2012-01-27

         Mostly spec changes (some major, backward-incompatible). Implementation
         still minimal/incomplete.

         + [INCOMPATIBLE] No more hash form! Now schema is either string or
           array. I've always hated writing the hash form and 99% always used
           the array form. Hash form can be re-added in the future in the
           unlikely event that we need it.

         + [INCOMPATIBLE] Array form now only allows one clause sets. To specify
           multiple clause sets, now there is a new clause named 'csets'. This
           is an application of Huffman encoding principle, as specifying
           multiple clause sets is relatively rare. The third element of array
           now can be used for other purposes, it is now an optional hash to
           store future extra stuffs.

         + [INCOMPATIBLE] Change merge prefixes, from the default provided by
           Data::ModeMerge (!, +, -, ^, et al) to the more verbose ([merge],
           [merge:+], [merge:!], and so on). This is also an application of
           Huffman encoding principle, since merging is relatively rare. The !,
           etc prefixes are going to be reused for other purposes. For example,
           !clause now means setting the .revert attribute.

         + [INCOMPATIBLE] Change syntax of attribute, from 'CLAUSE:ATTR' and
           ':ATTR' to 'CLAUSE.ATTR' and '.ATTR'. Using dot is nicer and now
           possible as the first character since we have changed merge prefixes.

         + Introduce shortcuts

         + [INCOMPATIBLE] String shortcuts are cut back. Now only 'foo*' is
           supported, to mean [foo => {req=>1}]. I find that this is the only
           shortcut that is commonly used, the rest not so much. Limiting the
           shortcuts feature allows simplifying the schema for Sah itself (no
           grammar needed, only a single regex needed to validate).

         + [INCOMPATIBLE] Sortable types: rename clause {min,max,between}ex ->
           x{min,max,between}

         + Type now can have namespaces too (e.g. MyCompany::order_id)

         + Add new clauses 'name', 'summary', 'description', 'tags'

         + (Re-)add manuals

Revision history for Data-Sah

0.41    2015-01-06 (PERLANCAR)

	- No functional changes.

	- Use Regexp::Stringify.


0.40    2015-01-04 (PERLANCAR)

        - On js (node) error, show output. Also, capture $? and $! before being
          reset (trying to find out the cause of error reported in [RT#101269]).


0.39    2015-01-03 (PERLANCAR)

	- No functional changes.

	- Rebuild (Generate TODO.md).


0.38    2015-01-02 (PERLANCAR)

	- Fix production of regex literal in perl compiler; also, now
	  produces 5.10-compatible regex literal.


0.37    2015-01-02 (PERLANCAR)

	- Incorporate Data::Sah::MoreUtils as Data::Sah::Util::Type.

	- [Incompatible change] Rename Data::Sah::Util::Type ->
	  Data::Sah::Util::Type::Date.


0.36    2014-12-27 (PERLANCAR)

        - No functional changes.

        - Replace Module::Path with Module::Path::More.

        - POD fixes/tweaks: add more examples in Synopsis, fix typos/grammar.


0.35    2014-12-19 (PERLANCAR)

	- Change Perl compiler to generate code that use
	  Scalar::Util::Numeric's isneg() & isinf() instead of direct
	  comparison =='inf' or =='-inf' to check for is_{,neg_,pos_}inf
	  clauses, because that might result in failure in some systems
	  (ref: https://github.com/perlancar/perl-Data-Sah/issues/2).


0.34    2014-12-19 (PERLANCAR)

	- No functional changes.

        - Format diagnostics message.


0.33    2014-12-19 (PERLANCAR)

	- No functional changes.

	- Refactor test routine into module Test::Data::Sah.

        - Give better test names and more diagnostics message upon failure, to
          help diagnose GH#2.


0.32    2014-12-10 (PERLANCAR)

	- No functional changes.

	- Use new name of renamed/split module SHARYANTO::String::Util ->
	  String::LineNumber & String::Indent.


0.31     2014-11-07 (PERLANCAR)

         - No functional changes.

         - Wording changes for error messages, the term/noun 'input' is removed
           because Sah is not limited to being used to validate input but also
           output/result. That specific term can be confusing.


0.30     2014-10-23 (PERLANCAR)

         - Support 'encoding' clause for string (specified Sah 0.9.31):
           currently does nothing.

         - Extract normalize_clset & normalize_schema to its own dist/module
           Data::Sah::Normalize. This is to significantly reduce dependencies
           for modules that just want to normalize schemas.


0.29     2014-06-30 (SHARYANTO)

         - No functional changes.

         - Replace Scalar::Util's looks_like_number() with
           Scalar::Util::Numeric's isint, isfloat, etc. This is because in 1.39,
           looks_like_number()'s result is booleanized.


0.28     2014-05-17 (SHARYANTO)

         - No functional changes.

         - Replace File::Slurp with File::Slurp::Tiny.


0.27     2014-05-04 (SHARYANTO)

         - Support string in the form of YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ format for date
           literal.


0.26     2014-04-28 (SHARYANTO)

         - No functional changes.

         - [build] Remove dependency to Language::Expr temporarily because it
           (RG actually) is broken.

         - Remove Data::Sah::Schema::* modules, they have been renamed to
           Sah::Schema::* and put into Sah and other dists.


0.25     2014-04-25 (SHARYANTO)

         - [bugfix] Some bug fixes for date.

         - Add debug note when setting temporary data term & restore orig data
           term.

         - Add module: Data::Sah::Util::Type.


0.24     2014-04-25 (SHARYANTO)

         - No functional changes.

         - Forgot to skip t/js-type-date.t when node.js is not available.


0.23     2014-04-25 (SHARYANTO)

         - Add (partial) support for type 'date'. Some human formatting not yet
           handled. You can already do things like specifying minimum/maximum
           date, but since properties are not supported yet you cannot say e.g.
           month must be August.


0.22     2014-01-09 (SHARYANTO)

         - No functional changes. Add test, tweak logging in generated code.

         [BUG FIXES]

         - Prog: data path (dpath) prefix was not shown for error message in
           expression version (err_expr), e.g. for hash clause req_keys.

         - JS: Fix error message for req_keys clause.


0.21     2014-01-03 (SHARYANTO)

         [BUG FIXES]

         - perl: req_keys clause: Avoid clashing of variable '$_' when '$dt'
           happens to contain '$_' also (can happen e.g. with schema like [array
           => of => [hash => req_keys => ["a"]]].


0.20     2013-11-25 (SHARYANTO)

         [ENHANCEMENTS]

         - Implement hash clause: 're_keys'.

         [BUG FIXES]

         - 'cistr' type: fix matching in perl >= 5.14.0 due to not yet handling
           (?^...:...) regex stringification form.

         [DOCUMENTATION]

         - Add Manual::Contributing.


0.19     2013-11-23 (SHARYANTO)

         [ENHANCEMENTS]

         - Implement types 'undef', 'cistr', 'buf'.

         - Implement clauses: 'ok', 'has'.

         - Implement hash clauses: req_keys (thanks Michal SedlÃ¡k),
           allowed_keys, allowed_keys_re, forbidden_keys, forbidden_keys_re.

         - Add modules: Data::Sah::JS, Data::Sah::Human.

         [ETC]

         - Adjust to Sah 0.9.29.

         [BUG FIXES]

         - Fix bug in generating human/error message for "between|".


0.18     2013-09-11 (SHARYANTO)

         - Add 'use experimental smartmatch' in generated code so that the
           generated code compiles cleanly on Perl 5.18+ [CT].


0.17     2013-09-09 (SHARYANTO)

         - No functional changes. Add 'use experimental smartmatch' for Perl
           5.18+ [CT].


0.16     2013-08-11 (SHARYANTO)

         - Tweak docs.

         - Handle case when LANGUAGE/LANG is ''.


0.15     2013-03-11 (SHARYANTO)

         - No functional changes. Avoid perl undef warning in human compiler
           (e.g. when schema is [int => default => undef]).


0.14     2013-02-07 (SHARYANTO)

         - This is the first release that includes a working js compiler. Along
           with this release are some fixes and refactorings.


0.13     2013-01-18 (SHARYANTO)

         [ENHANCEMENTS]

         - Slightly tweak max/re clauses so the human can generate clauses in
           nicer order, e.g. "at least X, at most Y" instead of "at most Y, at
           least X" (since max is alphabetically smaller than min).

         [BUG FIXES]

         - Fallback to en_US if Data::Sah::Lang::$lang cannot be found [CT
           reports].

         - Alphabetical sorting of clause names used wrong variables [CT
           report].


0.12     2013-01-16 (SHARYANTO)

         - No functional changes. Add a human test.


0.11     2013-01-16 (SHARYANTO)

         - No functional changes. Minor fixes/adjustments [CT reports].


0.10     2013-01-11 (SHARYANTO)

         - 0.09 was also broken, sorry.

         [ENHANCEMENTS]

         - Now follow Sah 0.9.23 spec (previously 0.9.19).

         - Basic human compiler now works, with English and Indonesian
           translation. The Perl compiler is now using error messages produced
           by the human compiler. Error message also now indicates data path,
           e.g. if there is an error in the second element of array data, it
           shows '@1'.

         - Line number when logging generated validator/schema code can be
           omitted by setting environment variable LINENUM=0.

         [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

         - Rename compile option 'mark_fallback' to 'mark_missing_translation'
           to make it clearer.

         [REMOVED FEATURES]

         - Remove min

         [BUG FIXES]

         - Subcompilation now uses all options from parent (except those that
           need to be set/changed by the subcompilation).

         - Various fixes and refactorings.


0.09     2012-11-22 (SHARYANTO)

         - 0.08 was broken, sorry.

         [ENHANCEMENTS]

         - Add gen_validator() options: accept_ref and source. Unknown options
           are still passed to Perl schema compiler.

         - Add compile() option: skip_clause.

         - perl: Implement hash's keys, keys.restrict, keys.create_default.
           Implement array's elems, elems.create_default.

         [REFACTORING]

         - Split Data::Sah::Util{::Role,::TypeX} so each can stay slim.


0.08     2012-11-06 (SHARYANTO)

         [ENHANCEMENTS]

         - Add compile option: 'comment' (to allow stripping comment in
           generated code).

         - perl: Implement str's {match, is_re}, obj's {can, isa}.

         - Add a way to control logging of generated code via
           $Log_Validator_Code or LOG_SAH_VALIDATOR_CODE.


0.07     2012-11-01 (SHARYANTO)

         [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

         - Remove module Data::Sah::Simple (IMO Data::Sah is not large enough to
           warrant a 'simple' variant). Data::Sah now can export
           'normalize_schema' as well as 'gen_validator'.

         - Rename compile option 'validator_return_type' to 'return_type'
           (Huffman encoding).

         [REMOVED FEATURES]

         - Remove compile(), perl(), human(), js() to make things more
           orthogonal. They are just shortcuts, and I reckon they will not be
           used relatively often.


0.06     2012-10-26 (SHARYANTO)

         - Follow latest Sah spec (0.9.16).

         - perl: Handle more types and clauses: array's 'of', str (incomplete),
           hash (incomplete), bool (incomplete), any, all. Data::Sah can now
           handle compilation of schemas from Perinci-Sub-Wrapper and
           Perinci-Examples! Finally, it's starting to be usable (happy face).

         - Some refactoring (rename modules).


0.05     2012-10-25 (SHARYANTO)

         - Split spec to Sah. To follow spec changes, see Sah's Changes.

         - Many changes following latest Sah spec (0.9.15).

         - Simplify compiler interface a bit: no longer accept multiple input.
           However, result is now a data structure ('$cd') instead of string,
           for more flexibility.

         - Generating Perl validator now works for simple schemas, like "int",
           ["array*", {min_len=>1, max_len=>10}]. There are still many types and
           clauses not yet implemented (currently only "int", "float", and
           "array" types are supported; more will be coming soon).

         - Add module Data::Sah::Simple.

         - Add compile() option: on_unhandled_{clause,attr}.


0.04     2012-07-20 (SHARYANTO)

         - No functional changes. Rebuild because dzil still included files in
           lib-disabled/.


0.03     2012-07-20 (SHARYANTO)

         - Mostly spec changes (syntax changes, lots of removed clauses to be
           more orthogonal). Implementation is still grossly incomplete.

         - (spec) New clause 'cset' to contain a clause set inside a clause.
           This provides a more elegant way to nest clauses, with possibly
           complex relationships (combine with {max,min}_{ok,nok} attributes).

         - [INCOMPATIBLE] (spec) Remove {max,min}_{ok,nok} *clauses*. They are
           now purely attributes. To apply to a set of clauses, apply to the
           new 'cset' clause.

         - [INCOMPATIBLE] (spec) Rename 'value' and 'values' attribute to
           'val'/'vals'. (Huffman principle)

         - [INCOMPATIBLE] (spec) Remove 'CLAUSENAME.*' syntax, it's ugly.

         - [INCOMPATIBLE] (spec) Change 'if' clause syntax: [if, expr, EXPR,
           cset, CSET]. Might probably change again :-)

         - [INCOMPATIBLE] (spec) Change merge prefix syntax from [merge:OP] to
           [mergeOP], e.g. [merge+]. (Huffman principle)

         - [INCOMPATIBLE] (spec) Remove unnecessary 'str' clauses: match_all,
           match_any, not_match, match_none (they can be replaced with the more
           generic clause sttributes 'values' and {min,max}_{ok,nok})

         - [INCOMPATIBLE] (spec) Remove unnecessary 'int' clauses: indiv_by (can
           be replaced with the more generic clause attributes 'values' and
           {min,max}_{ok,nok})

         - [INCOMPATIBLE] (spec) Remove unnecessary 'HasElems' clauses: has_all,
           has_any, has_none (can be replaced with the more generic clause
           attributes 'values' and {min,max}_{ok,nok})

         - [INCOMPATIBLE] (spec) Remove unnecessary 'Comparable' clauses: isnt,
           not_in (can be replaced with the more generic clause attributes
           'values' and {min,max}_{ok,nok})

         - [INCOMPATIBLE] (spec) Remove .revert attribute, use .max_ok instead

         - '.attr' clause is now allowed again.

         - (spec) New attribute: default_lang (like in Rinci)

         - Remove warning under Perl 5.16 [RT#78491]


0.02     2012-01-27 (SHARYANTO)

         - Mostly spec changes (some major, backward-incompatible).
           Implementation still minimal/incomplete.

         - [INCOMPATIBLE] No more hash form! Now schema is either string or
           array. I've always hated writing the hash form and 99% always used
           the array form. Hash form can be re-added in the future in the
           unlikely event that we need it.

         - [INCOMPATIBLE] Array form now only allows one clause sets. To specify
           multiple clause sets, now there is a new clause named 'csets'. This
           is an application of Huffman encoding principle, as specifying
           multiple clause sets is relatively rare. The third element of array
           now can be used for other purposes, it is now an optional hash to
           store future extra stuffs.

         - [INCOMPATIBLE] Change merge prefixes, from the default provided by
           Data::ModeMerge (!, +, -, ^, et al) to the more verbose ([merge],
           [merge:+], [merge:!], and so on). This is also an application of
           Huffman encoding principle, since merging is relatively rare. The !,
           etc prefixes are going to be reused for other purposes. For example,
           !clause now means setting the .max_ok attribute to 0.

         - [INCOMPATIBLE] Change syntax of attribute, from 'CLAUSE:ATTR' and
           ':ATTR' to 'CLAUSE.ATTR' and '.ATTR'. Using dot is nicer and now
           possible as the first character since we have changed merge prefixes.

         - Introduce shortcuts

         - [INCOMPATIBLE] String shortcuts are cut back. Now only 'foo*' is
           supported, to mean [foo => {req=>1}]. I find that this is the only
           shortcut that is commonly used, the rest not so much. Limiting the
           shortcuts feature allows simplifying the schema for Sah itself (no
           grammar needed, only a single regex needed to validate).

         - [INCOMPATIBLE] Sortable types: rename clause {min,max,between}ex ->
           x{min,max,between}

         - Type now can have namespaces too (e.g. MyCompany::order_id)

         - Add new clauses 'name', 'summary', 'description', 'tags'

         - (Re-)add manuals


0.01     2011-11-23 (SHARYANTO)

         - First release, very preliminary, almost nothing is implemented.
           Changes from old Data::Schema:

         - [INCOMPATIBLE] Terminology changes: 'attribute' becomes 'clause', to
           make it less ambiguous.
